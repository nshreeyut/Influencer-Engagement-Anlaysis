Like, for sure you could get swabbed for staph and you could try different medication/creams. But I just want to comfort you by saying that you should not feel any sort of “horror” from this issue. SO many people have butt acne. I’m not excluded from that statement. Butts go places the rest of us don’t (toilet seats, under heavy clothing that gets pressed up against them all day while we’re working, etc.) The skin there is delicate, but it doesn’t get the same attention as hands/faces so it often winds up breaking out. You shouldn’t feel any shame about it. Millions of butts look exactly like this. IMO, this isn’t even bad. It looks pretty standard to me lol. I have a pretty zitty ass because I sit all day and then I go to the gym. I have found some relief in frequent physical exfoliation with an African net sponge BUT there’s just some days my ass looks just like this and that’s pretty normal. Put that butt in a bikini and go enjoy life.

1ka48td,[Acne] Butt acne/folliculitis (help),mpjcj36,"cut down on the physical exfoliation, get off your ass during the day as much as possible (no, not exercise for 30m a day, literally just dont sit down a lot), see if the material of your underwear is causing it (could be synthetic). Also, address anything that might be causing hormonal imbalances, because this can be indicative of it.

Your shower routine should now look like this (excluding hair washing and stuff):

1. get wet with lukewarm or cool water, not hot water, and get properly wet not just rinsing
2. use a bar soap that is NOT antibacterial. antibacterial soaps are shit for your skin and will do more harm than good. Additionally, normal soap suffices and is exactly the same. Get dove bar soap or something
3. rinse off soap
4. use a chemical exfoliant, NOT a physical exfoliant like a scrub or a loofah or whatever. obvs use a washcloth elsewhere, but avoid acne areas
5. rinse off, dry off, use a toner OR witch hazel, let it sit til completely dry
6. moisturise
7. wear loose clothing or entirely omit underwear for a while. Personally I sleep naked so that helps.

Good luck.

While folliculitis on the butt is extremely common, it also *could* be something infectious and treatable. 

My personal story: I was blessed with body acne along with my face acne. It all cleared up when I did accutane, but some time after, it came back… only on my butt. A place I hadn’t had it before (chest and upper back were my worst zones). I thought it was due to my chosen methods of hair removal (shaving, waxing, and/or epilation), so I did laser hair removal and electrolysis on whatever would take but I still do have fine peach fuzz everywhere. It improved marginally, if at all. I kind of just *dealt* and then after a filthy fucking outdoors event that left us all completely covered in noxious smelling mud, it got worse. In addition to more pustules than usual, my whole bottom was red and itchy, so I mentioned it to my dermatologist. She gave me a topical cream (I believe it was gentamycin edit: or it could have been mupirocin?), but it didn’t help, or not enough, so then she prescribed me an oral antibiotic (keflex?). That did the trick. I finished out the course and not only did it clear up the red itchy eruption, but even the regular folliculitis/acne never came back. And I mean never. It has been like 8 years now. I find myself wonder if it isn’t possible I was colonized by a milder staph or something similar for a long time, and then the mud run had a nastier variety edge out what had been there, and then the antibiotic took care of it.

Chlorhexidine gluconate 4% (brand name is hibiclens, but you can get the generic dye free kind without the pump at any pharmacy in the shelf) is what I use during every shower (i shower once, sometimes twice a day). 


It took about two, almost three months of regular use to really clear up. 


Avoid exfoliating until it's cleared up or it makes it worse! That includes AHAs, BHAs, the KP scrub, manual exfoliating, all that! 


Once it's cleared up and you have no active breakouts, do the exfoliating treatments to treat the scars and discoloration. I'm in the exfoliating stage now. ",16,1745873069.0,369,228

1k9i6lb,[personal] I completely ruined my skin and hate myself self now,mpetqrz,"Hey OP. I remembered seeing your post the other day on this, and can see you posted it several times in the last week.

So I get the impression this is something that's really panicking you and that you're fixating on. I feel for you, because I've been there. 

You've received hundreds of replies with really good advice and re-assurance - take a deep breath, read them, and know it's going to be ok!

You also uploaded a picture of your skin before, and as others commented it definitely doesn't appear to look the way you're describing in that photo, and as it looks to you. I know that maybe doesn't help with how it feels to you, but it's true. 

I'm not saying this to invalidate you, but I'm concerned about you feeling you've permanently damaged your skin/are afraid to look in the mirror. I'm also concerned that you may be obsessing over this, and are at risk of doing too many things to it now due to the belief you need to ""fix"" it. Like I said, I've been there before and I didn't need to be. 

Is seeking a dermatogist an option for you, perhaps to see if hearing this guidance from a professional can re-assure you more/help with some of the fear, as well as the issues you're describing? As someone who used to have quite an unhealthy fixation on my skin/parts of my body, and this idea I needed to ""fix them"" all the time, I think that could help you. I suspect some of this might be psychological <3


It's going to be okay",1402,1745803370.0,307,122
1k9i6lb,[personal] I completely ruined my skin and hate myself self now,mpejy1x,Your skin will regenerate. Leave it alone. Well I mean it will regenerate if that's as far as the damage went.

1k9i6lb,[personal] I completely ruined my skin and hate myself self now,mpeo8pm,"I think all skincare problems can be improved by restoring your barrier. It sounds like you need to nurture your barrier and drop all actives for a while. I would introduce a gentle cleanser, a hydrating toner and serum with no actives, and aestura 365 cream or zeroid soothing cream. Layer on the hydrating toners bc your barrier desperately needs humectants; they make up for TEWL. Something like mixsoon glacier water layered 3x can turn your skin around overnight if sealed in with a moisturizer.

Also, I *highly* recommend badger baby diaper rash cream. It is some kind of magic ointment that can improve your skin overnight. The zinc, sunflower oil, and calendula does an amazing job at soothing and shutting down redness and healing. 

Just use these products for about 3 weeks—no actives—and your skin should show some noticeable improvement.",91,1745801324.0,307,122
1k9i6lb,[personal] I completely ruined my skin and hate myself self now,mpesxnd,"Though I have “normal” but highly sensitive skin, I’ve been in a similar predicament. First, STOP all usage of facial products. I’m serious. None. Use a little warm water to “wash” your face and leave it alone. Skin will naturally heal from abrasive products. Next, start testing different products to get your skin back in shape in the lightest way possible. I use Cerave Facial Cleanser day and night. It’s super light and feels like a lotion. It’s non-irritating and I have severely sensitive skin. I also use Cetaphil products because they’re great for sensitive skin. Anything else makes my face turn red and into a monster from the chemicals. But be careful with “all-natural” products. Many are natural, but then add irritating essential oils, etc… I also only use unscented products from my facial cleaners to serums to moisturizers. You have to test a couple brands to find the right ones. 

Worst case scenario and that doesn’t help, I’d just go see a Dermatologist for additional help. I hope this helps!",13,1745803070.0,307,122
1k9i6lb,[personal] I completely ruined my skin and hate myself self now,mpek8c9,"Definitely sounds like you went a little bananas with the harsh products and destroyed your skin barrier! 
My skin is reactive but typically clear but last winter my skin was beat and dry from wind burn. Sometimes when it gets so sensitive and dry it will start overproducing oil to try to compensate, which then clogs your pores. Truely the worst of both worlds! Luckily you can do some work to repair your skin barrier and it should eventually find it’s normal again. 
You have the right idea by stopping all unnecessary products. Even things your skin can usually tolerate might be too harsh for your skin right now. If you’re not already, I’d start by only cleansing at night with something very gentle like neutragenas ultra gentle cleanser. Then I’d do a thicker moisturizer for overnight just to promote hydration and get your skin too hopefully cool down on the oil production. Cera Ve overnight cream is a cult classic. Then on the especially dry and irritated bits apply some kind of occlusive to keep the moisturizer from evaporating and give it more time to nourish those sensitive spots. Vaseline works but I particularly like egyption magic. It’s on Amazon and it’s a basically coconut oil with a lot of bee products that are naturally anti bacterial and very soothing. Skip cleansing in the morning. If your face feels oily in the morning, just give it a little rinse with water. Then apply a soothing moisturizer without any fragrance and a sunscreen. The sunscreen will help prevent the sun from irritating it more as well as a lot of other benefits. Once your skin has recovered and is less irritated I’d get a deep cleansing facial just to get the remaining junk out of the pores. Wait until it’s significantly less irritated though, you don’t want someone to be pushing and prodding on it while it’s trying to heal or accidentally applying something that’s just too harsh on your skin right now. 
In my case is was a solid 4-6 months before my skin felt completely normal again. Which is definitely hard. But it left me with a whole new thankfulness for my skin and a healthy fear of slathering on a new product just for the hell of it. Remember this won’t last forever! Your skin barrier will heal! Just be patient, consistent and kind to your skin and go easy on the abrasives from now on. Good luck!",9,1745799851.0,307,122

1k9i6lb,[personal] I completely ruined my skin and hate myself self now,mpfdwat,"hi OP, i don’t usually comment but i’ve seen the photos you posted, been exactly where you are and i know how it feels. disclaimer: this is my (extremely specific) journey and what worked for me won’t work for everyone.

i had perfect skin since young as well, matte, no pores, no hyperpigmentation, no texture, smooth like a peeled egg. everyone would compliment me and it was one of my defining “traits”. it was on the dry side though (never had a pimple) so i only used cleanser once a day. two years ago i started to incorporate skincare products for the first time (toner, serum, moisturiser) and ended up with itchy clogged pores, tiny bumps all over and red patches. i started using salicylic acid and other exfoliants, thinking it would get rid of it, but all it did was damage my skin barrier even more. it was a constant cycle of thinking this new product would help, trying it, getting opposite results, stop everything, trying another new product, getting opposite results again, stopping it. it felt like all hope was lost, there was no end in sight and i would never get my old skin back. i would look in the mirror everyday first thing in the morning and cry. bright lighting became my enemy. i lost all my confidence and hated myself for ever touching skincare and ruining something that didnt need improving in the first place. people around me did notice that my skin was worse, even though they assured me that this was still how most normal people’s skin looked. but it still affected me so much, because it just was not my skin before. eventually i took a long break from work (i had a job that required me to wear makeup everyday and irregular sleeping hours, making it impossible for my skin barrier to regenerate) and stayed at home in darkness with the curtains drawn, nothing on my face, washing with only water at night, drinking plenty of water and sleeping by 10pm everyday. i was just so scared to try any new skincare products for fear of it becoming worse. after 3 months, my skin had improved significantly in terms of redness but still felt flaky, dry and tight. so i started to incorporate the la mer moisturiser - i know people shit on it but i do have a history of eczema and it genuinely worked for me. i won’t be using skincare from other brands anymore (this is coming from someone who has tried over 30 moisturisers, lol). eventually i incorporated other la mer products as well - like the concentrate - and my healing process has been really fast. it’s been about 6 months now. apart from 3 small hyperpigmentation spots on my left cheek, i would say that my skin is 95% back to how it was before.

tldr; skincare products work differently for everyone but i hope you find what works for you. above all else, prioritise your skin barrier. if what you say is true, your base is already good so you just have to let time do the healing. it won’t be like this forever. and in the meantime, remember that your skin does not define you. i know it’s easier said than done (i’ve experienced it firsthand), but try not to let it stop you from living your life. i would constantly cancel appointments with friends due to my skin and it’s just not worth it… spend time with those who love you and eventually everything will sort itself out. stay strong OP, sending you encouragement and best wishes. let me know if you have any other questions, i’d be happy to answer.",3,1745811252.0,307,122

1k9d1q5,[Hair Removal] Chemical Burn from Nair!,mpen2vc,"NAD, work inpatient in a hospital where we get lots of cases of cellulitis + similar skin infections. if you can see a doctor, see one - even if it's something like urgent care. if you can see a dermatologist, even better. that looks like a 2nd degree burn in some spots and your epidermis is quite literally peeling away. it's also in a rather delicate location, and i particularly worry about infections starting in warm, moist places like the folds of the neck when you bring your chin down. the face is a bad place for any skin infections to start, and burns get infected so easily.

i think you should be on a course of antibiotics until the worst of it is healed to prevent anything from growing. a doctor can prescribe that, and can also show you how to do gauze changes that are less irritating.

i recommend a very thick occlusive to help trap in the moisture, plus gauze covering on the worst spots. i know, people think ""oh but it's so pore-clogging"" - doesn't matter, we're talking about the integrity of your skin tissue and making sure it retains moisture. if you let it dry out, it'll scar more prominently and could crack and split open since it's in the neck region, which has a lot of movement.

very regular/liberal dressing changes too. to make changing gauze less painful, dampen it with a bit of water before removing to help prevent the tissues and serosanguinous fluid from 'clinging' to the bandaging which can be painful.",110,1745800892.0,167,78

1k9d1q5,[Hair Removal] Chemical Burn from Nair!,mpef33z,"What to do right now (from someone who had a chemical burn a few months ago):
• Rinse with cool water for 10–15 minutes if you haven’t already.
• Use a cold compress on the area for 10 minutes at a time to soothe it.
• Apply burn gel (like one with lidocaine) or pure aloe vera gel to keep it cool and moist. DO NOT use Neosporin or an antibiotic cream until after your doctor’s visit. They can make it worse or further upset the burn. 
• Take ibuprofen if you can, for pain and swelling.
• Cover it up with gauze before you go to the doctor
• Keep it clean and don’t use any harsh products, makeup, or sunscreen on it yet.
• Avoid picking or touching the skin as much as possible.
• Stay out of the sun — if you have to go outside, cover the area with clothing (like a hat or scarf) instead of sunscreen for now. Sunscreen could make it worse while it’s an open wound.

When you get to the doctor, make sure you tell them if you have any pus or discharge, swelling, pain, fever, or skin color changes.

Keep it clean, I believe you sould still be able to use your face wash if it doesn't burn more than water, avoid alcohol and hydrogen peroxide: alcohol dries the skin and inhibits healing (and burns like hell) and hydrogen peroxide messes with healing too, use hipoclorous acid (microdacyn is the most famous brand)

Use vaseline on it, if your face cream doesn't burn more than water you should even layer the vaseline on top of it, keeping the skin hydrated is important for healing and vaseline acts as a protective layer

Avoid the Sun and I'm not even sure you should be using sunscreen, ask that to the doctor, dermatologist if you can",3,1745809193.0,167,78

1k8na6x,[acne] almost 30 and my skin is awful,mp7o5i6,"I tried 4 derms before the fourth one put me on accutane. Most derm clinics don’t even offer it (most derms are slightly annoyed by acne patients in general because they make so little money from treating acne vs doing other services). 

If I could go back and do it again I would sue the online accutane provider like Honeydewcare. I think that’s the name of one of them. You don’t have to do as many lab tests in person and it’s less expensive. I think everyone should at least try it. Accutane is just a clinically high dose of vitamin A. Antibiotics have have worse side effects profiles compared to accutane. Worth a try!

Or you could try a combo tx - like BHA plus the retinoid, sulfur plus the retinoid, etc.

Low dose accutane is another possibility.

I’m 30, about to turn 31, and have had 4 rounds of accutane in addition to every topical under the sun. Spironolactone lowered my blood pressure too much so I had to stop it. My 71 year old father still gets acne, so I know the genes I have are fighting me tooth and nail and that this will be my life.

I noticed starting at 29 that things were getting worse again. I got a PCOS diagnosis, and trialed lots of different birth controls. I am by no means acne free, but I feel like I currently have it under control with only one small breakout around my period.

What worked for me was trialing different birth controls and a long consistent dose of minocycline. I also drink spearmint tea a few times a week, and see a dermatologist and obgyn semi regularly. I’m now on a long term low dose of minocycline. I also use a topical compounded spironolactone (brand name Winlevi) to reduce sebum production and topical called Aklief that is gentler than tret. 

All I can say is that I understand your pain. It’s exhausting to fight with your skin and your body. My derm comforted me a little by reminding me that the body goes through hormonal shifts as we age and that symptoms might be worse during these times.

In an effort to use it up; I have taken to using a pea sized amount as a makeup primer. It does work really well for this if you use the tiniest amount possible - but that also means needing to use another product underneath for your actual sunscreen + makeup that will play nicely with the silicone so it’s still more effort than it’s worth.",5,1746023306.0,56,8

1k8safg,[Acne] Chest acne is CRAZY,mp8ybjo,"i'd stop using the banila cleansing balm.  try using something like Derm Made sulfur and BHA liquid cleanser (I buy it from Dr. Leslie Baumman's Skin Type Solutions website), or Panoxyl or Cerave's 4% BP acne wash, leave on for 2 min b4 rinsing.  and try skipping using lotion 2x/day.  just use it once per day.  are u working out and getting all sweaty and not washing immediately after? because i get these same kinds of little reddish pimples whenever i get sweaty and am not able to wash off right away.  this looks like TOO much moisture.

 if you can't wash, try using cotton pads with a bha and zinc toner and wiping down face and chest.  You could also use this as a tx even after washing.  Some options are:  1. good old Bonne Bell 10-0-6 deep pore lotion (the old golden liquid w/ alcohol and lactic acid), 2. Personal Day Doing the Work w/ BHA, zinc, and azelaic acid, 3.

1k8safg,[Acne] Chest acne is CRAZY,mp8ybx0,"Have you tried glycolic acid, I like it on my body but not my face. Try a body acne spray one that’s not salicylic acid based? Try cutting out fragrance and oil from your skin care and laundry too to see if that helps. My best advice is to try a gel moisturizer instead of a lotion/cream formulation. I wouldn’t really want gold bond on my body, I would only use that on my feet or hands for super rough skin. Change the sheets once a week at least as well. 

They’re all fairly uniform in size and shape, if they look the same on your face too it could potentially be fungal. You can possibly get a prescription for antibiotics to help clear it up. I got my stuff through tele-health, much faster than waiting to see a derm in person.",3,1745719847.0,33,72

Fungal acne is very common, especially when it gets warmer and humid. What you can do is see a dermatologist to get a proper diagnosis.
