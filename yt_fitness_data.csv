_GziHDdJY10,Don’t Skip These 3 Biceps Exercises,"Here are my top 3 biceps exercises of all time.

In 3rd place - the EZ bar curl. Compared to a straight bar, these put my wrists in a more comfortable position, which is important because I hit these with heavier weight in the 6-8 rep range.

In 2nd place - the hammer curl. Even though these might target the brachialis a bit more than the biceps per se, the brachialis is actually the same size as both heads of the biceps combined. And it pushes the biceps up and out more, giving the illusion of bigger biceps.

You can probably make these even more effective by doing the preacher hammer curl. By fixing your arm against a preacher bench, you pull tension into the bottom range of motion; where you get the deepest stretch — the bench also prevents cheating. 

And my number one exercise gives a huge stretch on the biceps, even tension throughout the range of motion, it feels good, and it’s easy to overload. It’s the bayesian cable curl.","biceps exercises, biceps exercise, exercises for biceps, exercise for biceps, how to build big biceps, how to get big biceps, best biceps exercise, best biceps exercises, exercises for bigger biceps, biceps workout and exercises, how to get bigger biceps, how to build bigger biceps, biceps workout, big biceps workout, athleanx, jeff nippard biceps, jeff nippard arms, mike israetel arms, biceps tier list, tier list, biceps tier list jeff nippard, bayesian cable curl",447752,1830,8726418,2024-10-28T18:50:22Z,Jeff Nippard

yWnacRo2VbA,The BEST Way to Use Cardio to Lose Fat (Based on Science),"Do you need cardio for weight loss? And how much cardio should you actually do? Some say you don’t need any cardio for fat loss, whereas others say you gotta do a cardio workout every day. I was determined to find the truth. After reviewing the latest science, interviewing the smartest experts in the world, and speaking to some of the top natural bodybuilders in the industry, here’s what I found about using cardio to lose weight.

Special thanks to our guests for their valuable insight:

Do you need cardio for weight loss? Cardio isn’t nearly as effective as most people think when it comes to losing weight and fat because of the constrained energy model. Most research has shown that people who start doing cardio without any changes to their diet tend to lose 20-50% of what they’d expect from the calories they’ve burned. 

What about doing more cardio to lose weight? Without changing your diet, you’ve probably got to do a whole lot of cardio for it to have a meaningful effect on fat loss. Which isn’t a very efficient or realistic approach for most people.

The takeaway is that should think of cardio as a supplemental tool that you can stack on top of your diet to speed things up. 

But how much cardio, exactly, should you “stack on top”? I sought the opinions of Alberto Nunez, an extremely knowledgeable coach and lifetime drug-free pro bodybuilder who’s known for getting into insane levels of leanness, and Lee Lem, a natural bodybuilder just a few weeks out from his show. Surprisingly, both said that by using either a longer or more aggressive diet, they didn't really need cardio to lose weight or get into crazy shape.

But including cardio had its benefits. Alberto and Lee say maintaining a high daily step count helped them burn more calories and make sure they don’t get lazier as they get leaner.

But now I wanted to find out, on top of daily steps, how much actual “cardio” is required to get really lean? Here's Alberto's take: ""Usually the smaller the athlete, the more cardio we will have to do. It helps so they can eat a little bit more, which is obviously gonna help with the mental component to some extent.” But he also emphasized it’s lifestyle-dependent: ""I've had people do nothing. Nothing. And usually, this has to do with the occupation that if they don't move, they just get fired. So servers, personal trainers, labor-intensive jobs, things like that.""

But for most of his clients, ""7,000 steps on average as our baseline you have that set. I'd say most people, per week, are going to require 4 to 5 days of cardio to lose weight, ranging anywhere between 30 to 45 minutes.” This seemed to line up with Lee’s protocol as well. On top of 10,000 steps a day and lifting weights 4 times a week, he’s also doing 5x 30 minutes of cardio to lose weight.

But remember, this isn't just to get “six-pack abs lean”. We’re talking shredded. And they don’t do this much cardio right away. Whenever fat loss has stalled, and they’re not making progress, that’s typically when they decide whether or not they should add more cardio.

Now as for how much cardio per week YOU should aim for? What I’d recommend is start with Alberto’s recommendation of walking 7,000 steps a day as a baseline. Once you’re consistent with that, try adding in 2 to 3 20-minute cardio workouts per week. And although Lee and Alberto recommend cycling or the elliptical, you have plenty of other options when it comes to the type of cardio to lose weight. The key is to choose things you actually enjoy and can recover well from.

Now, from here, once your body adapts and you reach a stall in your progress using your current routine, you can choose to either eat a little bit less or add a little bit more cardio or steps to continue losing fat. You basically repeat this process for as long as it takes for you to reach your desired level of body fat.

But the last thing you want to do is start doing a bunch of cardio to lose weight during your diet and then stop cold turkey as soon as it’s over. Dr. Eric Helms says keeping some level of activity (7,000 to 9,000 steps per day and strength training 2-3x weekly) seems to prevent fat regain. This is why for long-term success, when choosing the type of cardio to lose weight, it’s so important to choose activities you can actually stick to.","cardio for weight loss, cardio, how much cardio, cardio for fat loss, cardio to lose weight, how much cardio for fat loss, cardio workout, weight loss workout at gym, best cardio for fat loss, how much cardio should I do to lose weight, how much cardio should I do, how to lose fat, how much cardio do you need to lose weight, builtwithscience, jeremyethier, cardio workout plan, cardio to lose fat, cardio to lose belly fat, how to lose belly fat, jeremy ethier, best cardio workout",117962,2355,5971436,2023-10-01T13:00:46Z,Jeremy Ethier

Wki3k1n59nE,Morning vs Evening Workout - What is Best Time To Workout ?,"Best Time to Workout: Morning vs Evening

Morning workouts can kickstart your metabolism, helping your body use fat for energy and keep your energy levels high throughout the day. On the other hand, evening workouts are great because your core temperature is higher, muscles are more flexible, and strength levels peak—perfect for heavy lifting and muscle building.

But honestly, for most people, what matters is *consistency*. Morning, afternoon, or evening, the best time to workout is when it’s sustainable for you. Movement is medicine, no matter the time.

However, if you’re a competitive athlete, you can use mornings for fat loss and evenings for strength gains. Hope this clears up the confusion!

_GziHDdJY10,Don’t Skip These 3 Biceps Exercises,"Here are my top 3 biceps exercises of all time.

In 3rd place - the EZ bar curl. Compared to a straight bar, these put my wrists in a more comfortable position, which is important because I hit these with heavier weight in the 6-8 rep range.

In 2nd place - the hammer curl. Even though these might target the brachialis a bit more than the biceps per se, the brachialis is actually the same size as both heads of the biceps combined. And it pushes the biceps up and out more, giving the illusion of bigger biceps.

You can probably make these even more effective by doing the preacher hammer curl. By fixing your arm against a preacher bench, you pull tension into the bottom range of motion; where you get the deepest stretch — the bench also prevents cheating. 

And my number one exercise gives a huge stretch on the biceps, even tension throughout the range of motion, it feels good, and it’s easy to overload. It’s the bayesian cable curl.","biceps exercises, biceps exercise, exercises for biceps, exercise for biceps, how to build big biceps, how to get big biceps, best biceps exercise, best biceps exercises, exercises for bigger biceps, biceps workout and exercises, how to get bigger biceps, how to build bigger biceps, biceps workout, big biceps workout, athleanx, jeff nippard biceps, jeff nippard arms, mike israetel arms, biceps tier list, tier list, biceps tier list jeff nippard, bayesian cable curl",447752,1830,8726418,2024-10-28T18:50:22Z,Jeff Nippard

eTxO5ZMxcsc,Full Body 5x Per Week: Why High Frequency Training Is So Effective,"Get my new full body program here: http://jeffnippard.com

If you’ve only been in the gym for a year or two, I’d recommend starting with my fundamentals program instead, which has you training full body 3 days a week instead of 5. https://www.jeffnippard.com/programs/fundamentals

More details on the new high frequency program:

This program is designed for intermediate to advanced trainees who are in need of something new to drive continued progress. This is a very unique training style that uses the highest possible frequency of training (hitting every muscle 5 days a week). Full body training has several advantages including:

- Reduced soreness = better performance
- Improved recovery capacity = more progress
- Improved mind-muscle connection per exercise = more focus
- High quality volumes = better muscle growth

Also includes:

- EXACT sets, reps, exercises, rest time, RPE targets
- Exercise substitutions
- Video links for every exercise
- Full summaries of volume for every bodypart
- “Program Explained” section
- A full FAQ’s section
- 39 scientific references

Anatomy tells us that the lats contribute heavily to biomechanical shoulder extension which is exactly what we’re doing with the close grip. Very high lat emphasis here.

Exercise 2: Chest-supported machine row. This is to target the mid-back like the rhomboids and mid-traps. I’m keeping my elbows higher and more flared while squeezing my shoulder blades together at the top and then feeling them pull apart on the way down.

Exercise 3: Close-grip cable row. This will the lats again with biomechanical shoulder extension, but from a horizontal angle this time. Once I hit failure, I keep going with lengthened partials.

Exercise 4: Reverse cable flyes for the rear delts – I’m using light weight and higher reps to prevent my mid traps from taking over.

Exercise 5: Shrugs for the upper traps. The upper trap fibers run way more horizontally than people realize, so shrug up and in toward your ears.

Exercise 6: Ez bar curl

Exercise 7: Machine preacher curl","push pull legs, push pull legs workout, push pull legs split, push pull legs workout split, ppl workout, ppl, ppl workouts, ppl workout split, ppl workout for size, ppl workout for muscle, workout for size, perfect push workout, ppl split, athlean-x, athlean x, jeff nippard push pull legs, pull workout, pull workouts, bicep workout, back and biceps workout, jeff nippard pull day, back workout for muscle, jeff nippard back, jeff nipard, back and biceps",366315,1754,6117227,2024-11-25T17:06:06Z,Jeff Nippard

eMjyvIQbn9M,The Best Science-Based Minimalist Workout Plan (Under 45 Mins),"My new ESSENTIALS Training Program: https://jeffnippard.com/products/the-essentials-program

Let’s goo!!! My long-awaited Essentials Program (short and intense workouts that take 45 mins) is available at the link above 😤📘 

Here is a brief overview of The Essentials Program:

1️⃣ - The workouts are designed to take no longer than 45 mins. These are perfect for anyone who wants to make the most of their time in the gym, but not spend half their day there.

2️⃣ - This program focuses on QUALITY over quantity. We will be training at a high intensity and focusing on individual set execution to drive gains as time-efficiently as possible. 

3️⃣ - Even though it is a minimalistic routine time-wise there is still a lot of variety. This is important to prevent boredom and stagnation. There are a number of unique exercises and techniques I haven’t used in any of my other programs! For most exercises we will be doing just 1-3 hard sets, so we have to make them count!

Here are some more details on what comes with the new program:

▪️ Appropriate for all training levels (assuming you’re looking to prioritize time-efficiency)
▪️ Option to train 2, 3, 4 or 5x per week.
▪️ 12 week program length (3 distinct blocks to avoid monotony).
▪️ Full custom Excel spreadsheet.
▪️ Videos and coaching cues from me for every exercise.
▪️ Exercise substitutions included.

In this video, I have explained about a Dumbbell Full Body Home Workout. It is a comprehensive exercise routine that targets multiple muscle groups using just a pair of dumbbells. This workout is designed to engage your chest, shoulders, triceps, lats, and legs, providing a balanced and effective training session. It typically includes a series of exercises such as dumbbell bench press or push-ups for chest, overhead press for shoulders, tricep extensions for triceps, bent-over rows for lats, and squats or lunges for legs. 

By combining these exercises, you'll be able to work on your upper body strength, core stability, and lower body endurance, all within the comfort of your home. Remember to start with an appropriate weight and gradually increase it as your strength improves. 

Always ensure proper form to prevent injuries and maximize the benefits of your workout.
