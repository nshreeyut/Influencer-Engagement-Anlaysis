So she left. But she didn’t leave the property. She was then yelling outside of the main entrance that “she was being harrassed, don’t come here” etc etc. which isn’t what was happening. She was the one that was making other members uncomfortable, being nasty to staff members. So she was told that if she tried to come back inside she’d be trespassing.

1k8081s,Gym Story Saturday,mpmau3g,"I joined a new gym about eight months ago.
Before that, I’d been going to several other gyms over the years — one for a bit over two years, and the rest for a few months or with day passes while I was moving around. So I’ve been lifting consistently for quite a while.

A few weeks ago, a trainer came up to me in the middle of my set and told me that some members had complained about my sweaty smell.
Now, I know no one smells like flowers and rainbows while working out, but I always wear freshly washed clothes, prep before the gym, and use deodorant.
In all my years of training, no one has ever said anything like that to me. I even asked former gym buddies and people I used to run with in the middle of summer, and they all said I smell completely normal.

I don’t want to assume the worst, but I’m starting to feel like this might be a racist thing.
I’m a foreigner living in a small village, and at this gym, I’m one of the very few people who lift seriously. Most of the members are older and go more for general mobility than weight training.
It kind of feels like they see me as “too much” and just want me gone.

Now I’m considering switching gyms, but the next closest one is in another village, and I’d have to drive there every time — which isn’t ideal.

Has anyone else experienced something like this?",6,1745908974.0,56,94
1k8081s,Gym Story Saturday,mp727c1,"I *never* go to the gym on the weekends, but after going too ham on Easter, Monday a non-starter (I didn't sleep from having acid reflux) and I didn't want to skip a day. 

So, that changed today.

Why the fuck do so many people bring their young, sticky, gross children to the gym on Saturdays? My gym does not have a daycare. These children are legally unable to hold memberships. Why are they here *touching fucking everything*? Why is there, what appears to be an 8 year old in the men's change room?

Why the fuck am I being exposed to this? 

I actually hate my gym more than I did before, which is a pretty difficult task since I absolutely *loathe* my gym with every fibre of my being. Between the dog-shit machine selection, single set of bumper plates for the entire gym to share, absurd membership fee, and functionally subsidizing a pool I will never use because public pools are fucking gross, I'm literally trying to figure out if I can afford a new house with a garage so I can put a gym in it.

For those of you wondering why I don't go to another gym: I live in a little podunk town and the next closest gym is a ~22 min commute. The fuel cost alone would make it more expensive and require 40 more minutes of my life every day to go since I work from home, so that's a total non-starter.

Most people in this sub don’t know what bodyfat percentages look like, leading to them estimating inaccurately. Also whenever someone wants their bodyfat estimated, you should post a pic of your legs and back as well. Just showing the front of your torso makes it harder to guess accurately. 

One of the only accurate methods of bodyfat testing is getting an MRI but that’s very expensive and a doctor isn’t going to give you one just to see your bodyfat percentage.

It doesn't actually train the hamstrings, right? I assume it's mostly quad training and some glutes involved, but hamstrings would be a bit of a stretch, right?

1k7gc2m,"Daily Simple Questions Thread - April 25, 2025",mozgdl6,"Hey guys,

I'm currently following a routine given by a coach I hired at a commercial gym. At first, I was making decent progress, but now I feel like I've stalled on some exercises altogether—I can’t seem to add more weight or reps no matter what approach I try.


I'm a 33-year-old male, 169 cm tall, and currently weigh 70 kg. When I started about a year ago, I was 62 kg. My short-term goal was to reach my current weight, and my long-term goal is to steadily gain strength by adding reps or weight at the beginning of each month.


Here’s my 4-day routine:

Day 1 – Chest and Triceps

4 x 12–15 close grip push-ups

4 x 6–8 barbell bench press (I've been stuck at 50 kg for a couple of months)

4 x 8–10 dumbbell incline bench press (20 kg)

4 x 8–10 incline dumbbell fly (14 kg)

4 x 10–12 dumbbell pullover (22 kg)

4 x 8–10 French press on bench (stuck at 12 kg)

4 x 6–8 seated French press (stuck at 22–26 kg)

4 x 8–10 triceps pulldown (23 kg)


Day 2 – Back and Biceps

4 x 6–7 close grip pull-ups (stuck at 7 max)

4 x 8–10 lat pulldown (52 kg)

4 x 8–10 seated row machine (stuck at 50 kg)

4 x 8–10 T-bar row (25–30 kg)

4 x 6–8 barbell bicep curls (can’t get past 15 kg)

4 x 6–8 cable bicep curls (18 kg)

4 x 8–10 concentration curls (10 kg) [I've been trying Scott curls instead]


Day 3 – Legs and Abs

4 x 6–8 Smith machine squats (60 kg)

4 x 8–10 fixed lunges with dumbbells (7 kg)

4 x 6–8 leg press (120 kg)

4 x 6–10 leg extension (54 kg)

4 x 6–8 seated leg curl (41 kg)

3 x 15 hanging leg raises and hanging oblique leg raises


Day 4 – Upper Body and Shoulders

4 x 8–10 dumbbell front raises (10 kg)

4 x 8–10 dumbbell lateral raises (10 kg)

4 x 8–10 rear delt pec fly (36 kg)

4 x 8–10 seated dumbbell press (18 kg)

4 x 12–15 barbell wrist curls (supination and pronation, 5 kg)

4 x 8–10 dumbbell alternate chest press with twist (20 kg)

4 x 8–10 single-arm seated row machine (25 kg)


How I go about my routine is pushing to 1–2 reps shy of failure and always putting in effort—I try to go out of breath with each exercise or at least get my heart pumping. I've tried techniques like 2–3 reps with 20 seconds of rest on exercises I’m hard-stuck with, but haven’t seen meaningful progress. I’ve also tried lowering reps and adding more weight, but most exercises just end up looking like baby reps or having terrible form.


I've worked with a couple of nutritionists, and the last one recommended the following daily macros:

2350 cal

140–160 g protein

50–60 g fat

280–300 g carbs


My main concern is whether the routine is good and worth sticking to, or if I should make changes. While progress has been slow, there has been some, so I'm not sure if the routine itself is the issue. About five years ago, I used to go to the gym 3–5 days a week, but I stopped a year into the pandemic. I started back roughly 10 months ago, and this time I’m trying to take it seriously.",1,1745594676.0,15,261

* My shoulder and back on the right side are smaller than the left, which is why I’ve included the single-arm rows and shrugs

I am not looking for anything too accurate as I know it is dependent on individual factors such as training age, quality of stimulus and a host of genetic factors, but simply a heuristic to make an expected guess as to how long a given amount of fat cut would take to re-accumulate over a bulk.

Some estimated ranges like 70-80% muscle 20-30% fat for +5-10% surplus, 40-60 for +15-20 etc (purely examples). If even such broad ballparks are not useful due to variation resulting from individual circumstances, then I guess knowing that would help, too. 

If it helps to give me a more personal estimate, I'm nearing 2 years in training age (or 1½ only accounting for time not in a deficit), and I'm planning on resuming a 'lean' bulk of around +5-7% caloric surplus (roughly 0.5 to 0.7kg or 0.6 to 0.8% bw/month).

1k88nzd,"Daily Simple Questions Thread - April 26, 2025",mp5c7d4,"I’ve started tracking macros and working out very recently (a month of playing around and about a month of being serious with a plan) and to save time I’ve started doing my 9 sets back to back. It’s not a super set? But essentially I’ll go through 10 reps of split squats followed immediately by 10 reps of Romanian deadlifts, one arm rows, dumbbell bench press, dumbbell overhead press, overhead dumbbell extension, dumbbell curl, 30 seconds of plank and 10 crunches. I’ll do this 3-5 times as my workout 2-3 times a week. 

My goal is to maintain muscle mass while in a deficit because I’ve lost 75 lbs and I don’t want to lose any muscle now that I’m closing in on my goal weight. My secondary goal is to do a pull up before my birthday! I gave myself 5 months to reach this goal but I’m absolutely amazed by how much closer I am getting every day. 

Is there a problem with doing the workout this way? I definitely get my heart racing and feel the burn by the end of the workout. Nothing crazy though, I’m not looking to grow my muscles per se. I am not pushing to failure, I am doing controlled movements and getting slower and more steady every day. I have to admit I have seen insane improvement since I’ve started doing this so I think I’m unintentionally growing my muscles. My body fat percentage and weight are going down steadily since starting the resistance training. I regularly incorporate cardio and started running up stairs on my walks too. 

I’m also curious about the difference between being a mesomorph and newbie gains? Is there any way to tell? I’ve always been husky and muscular but I attributed it to my weight.",1,1745676414.0,7,160

After a life of being very active but not really working out, I'm starting out doing upper body push/pull resistance training about three times a week. Usually three sets to failure or near-failure of four pulling exercises (wide grip pullups, neutral grip pullups, dumbell raises, lateral raises) and three pushing exercises (diamond pushups, dips, seated overhead dumbell presses). I have two main questions:

1. What's a good pushing exercise to add, preferably bodyweight?

2. I'm going to start doing core work and cardio either on off days or 4-6 hours before or after my main session. If these workouts involve some decently taxing strength movements themselves (i.e., pushups for burpees, dead hangs for leg raises), will that mess up my progress in my main workouts? Will minor overtraining like that tend to wreck my muscles or just not add more progress?",1,1745677463.0,7,160

I would do deadlifts and RDLs, and I’d do back squats and SSB squats. I hate the bar on my back and it’s a huge limiter in actually moving serious weight, so I’ve made SSB squats my main lift and dropped back squats. I’m looking for a secondary lift to switch things up. I’ve heard hex-bar deadlifts are actually more of a squat motion. Would that fit well in my existing lower body suite of lifts? I’d prefer to avoid front squats, as again, I just find the bar awkward to hold.

Well yesterday I tried to unrack the weight but I must have done it in a bad way because I got pain throughout my arm starting from my shoulder down to below my elbow.

Here is a photo of what the hooks look like: [https://postimg.cc/zL1VFZzV](https://postimg.cc/zL1VFZzV)

The way I do it now, is get in position, brace myself and then try to push up on the barbell but this doesn't work well at all. I'm used to doing it like this because that was how the bench in my old gym worked.

31y male, training experience 10+ years. A few weeks before start cutting, I started just recording ererything that I ate on the app and I came out to about 3300 +-50 calories per day at 101 kilograms (\~222 lbs).

I started losing weight at 2900 calories, but within 10 days my weight stayed the same. Then I started eating 2500 (250c/90f/170p) but after another 10 days my weight is the same 100.5 kilograms (\~220 lbs).

What tf am I doing wrong? I sleep 7-8 hours a day, work out regularly 4 times a week for years, my daily activity is even higher now than before (summer seasonal job), my strength in the gym hasn't changed. Do I need to keep cutting calories for good moderate weight loss, or wait for another 10 days? Or maybe change nutrients ratio?",1,1746004660.0,2,81
